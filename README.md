Description: Writing a porgram to reorder a list of images that are numbered in order to easily place them in a Canva file for printing double sided.
I will start by making a program that can transforms the numbers based on the reuired formula where multiples of 4 renamed to be "order(n-3)" 
and every other number is renamed to be "order(n+1)"
